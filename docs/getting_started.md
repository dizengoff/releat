# Getting Started

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Linux or WSL (for Windows OS)
- Docker
- VSCode (or your preferred IDE)

### Run Container

The simplest method is to use VSCode's Dev Container extension. The configuration is already set up in the `.devcontainer` folder. See the [official guide] on how to get it running. For alternative ways to build the Dockerfile or run the container see the [developer notes on containerisation](<development_notes/releat_dockerfile.md#building-the-container>).

[official guide]: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/tutorial

Install library and activate local environment and install the current project:

```
poetry install
source activate ./.venv
```
